SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
Hardware Requirements:
The hardware requirements for the proposed Age, Gender, and Emotion
Recognition system, which integrates deep learning and OpenCV for realtime
face analysis, depend on factors such as the scale of deployment, the
size of the dataset, and the computational complexity of the deep learning
model. Below is a general outline of the hardware requirements:
ï‚· CPU: A multi-core processor (e.g., Intel Core i7 or equivalent) for handling
real-time image processing and deep learning inference.
ï‚· GPU: A dedicated GPU (e.g., NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or better)
significantly accelerates deep learning model inference and training. For
large-scale deployments, an NVIDIA Tesla series GPU is recommended.
ï‚· RAM: A minimum of 16 GB RAM is recommended for handling large
datasets and ensuring smooth real-time inference.
ï‚· STORAGE: Adequate SSD storage (minimum 50 GB free space) is
preferable for storing deep learning models, datasets, and necessary
libraries.
ï‚· DESKTOP OR LAPTOP: Any modern desktop or laptop with internet
connectivity should be sufficient for running the system.
ï‚· WEB BROWSER: The user interface (if implemented with a web-based
dashboard) can be accessed through common browsers like Google
Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
ï‚· INTERNET CONNECTIVITY: A stable internet connection for
downloading models, datasets, and dependencies.
ï‚· CAMERA: A high-quality external webcam or built-in camera with at least
720p resolution for real-time face detection and analysis.
ï‚· DEVELOPMENT MACHINE: A powerful machine with GPU support for
training and fine-tuning the deep learning models.
ï‚· DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK: Adequate storage and computational
resources for running deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow in Python
IDLE 3.10 and VS Code for model development and training.
ï‚· Additional Considerations for Raspberry Pi Deployment:
ï‚· For optimization on Raspberry Pi:
ï‚· Model Optimization: Use TensorFlow Lite for better performance.
ï‚· Camera: Raspberry Pi Camera Module for facial detection.
ï‚· Hardware: Raspberry Pi 4B (4GB RAM or higher) for smooth operation.
ï‚· This configuration ensures efficient real-time age, gender, and emotion
recognition while optimizing system resources for various deployment
environments.
Software Requirements:
ï‚· Python Version: Python 3.10.
ï‚· Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV.
ï‚· Development Environment: Python IDLE 3.10, VS Code.
ï‚· Libraries: Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
ï‚· Operating System: Windows 11, Linux, or macOS.
Python IDLE:
Python IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment) is a
simple and lightweight IDE that comes bundled with Python. It provides a
straightforward interface for writing, editing, and executing Python scripts.
It is best suited for beginners and small-scale projects due to its simplicity
and ease of use. The IDLE shell allows for interactive execution of Python
commands, making it useful for debugging and quick testing.
VS Code:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful, extensible code editor
developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for Python development due to its
rich ecosystem of extensions, integrated debugging tools, and seamless
support for virtual environments. VS Code provides features like
IntelliSense (code suggestions), Git integration, and a built-in terminal,
making it an excellent choice for deep learning and large-scale Python
projects.
